# Article Tier List: Linux Desktop Environments

When it comes to Linux, the desktop environment is probably the most important thing for me because it defines the overall look and feel of the system. Each desktop environment comes with a set of system tools to tweak settings like screen resolution and other aspects. Let's dive into my tier list for various Linux desktop environments:

## Tier 1: "Pretty Good"

1. **Cinnamon** - I find Cinnamon great for new Linux users. Developed by the Linux Mint team, it offers a polished and user-friendly experience. Though it could have more customization options, I still recommend Linux Mint for newcomers.

2. **Deepin** - Deepin impresses me with its visual appeal and excellent scaling. It's not widely used, but I didn't encounter any significant issues during my usage.

3. **Budgie** - I didn't use Budgie extensively, but it deserves a spot in the "pretty good" category due to its polish and impressive options.

4. **KDE** - KDE is my personal favorite and probably the closest to the "Goat" tier. It offers a plethora of customization options, making it an excellent choice for users transitioning from Windows. However, it does have some bugs, and the overall polish is not as high as Cinnamon or Budgie.

5. **Xfce** - Xfce may seem average with a stock installation, but it becomes fantastic with proper customization. It's lightweight and great for users who want to personalize their desktop.

## Tier 2: "Average"

1. **LXDE** - LXDE is no longer widely used and has been deprecated. It's a lightweight desktop environment suitable for minimal systems.

2. **LXQt** - LXQt is the successor to LXDE, offering a similar lightweight experience. Like LXDE, it's a good option for minimal systems or low-spec hardware.

3. **Mate** - Mate is lighter than GNOME or KDE and evokes a nostalgic feeling with its resemblance to the old GNOME 2 interface.

4. **Unity** - Unity was deprecated for a while but has been resurrected by the community. However, due to the lack of strong support, I would be cautious about using it.

## Tier 3: "Dog Water"

1. **GNOME** - GNOME is functionally robust and polished, but I place it in this tier because of its extension system. Extensions can potentially introduce security vulnerabilities and cause breakages during feature updates.

2. **Pantheon (Elementary OS)** - Pantheon is designed to resemble macOS, which may appeal to Mac users. However, it's a matter of personal preference, and I find its look and feel less attractive.

## Tier 4: "Uncertain"

1. **CuteFish OS** - I have not used CuteFish OS enough to form an opinion. It remains an uncertain category for me.

## Conclusion

In my experience, each Linux desktop environment has its strengths and weaknesses. For new Linux users or those transitioning from other operating systems, exploring different desktop environments is essential to finding the one that best suits their needs and preferences. Keep in mind that this tier list is based on my personal opinions and experiences, and other users may have different perspectives.
